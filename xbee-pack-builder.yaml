schema-version: 1.0

description: |
  The Nettle package contains a low-level cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in many contexts.
  Installed Programs: nettle-hash, nettle-lfib-stream, nettle-pbkdf2, pkcs1-conv and sexp-conv
  Installed Libraries: libhogweed.so and libnettle.so
  Installed Directory: /usr/include/nettle and /usr/share/doc/nettle-3.7.3
  Short Descriptions
    nettle-hash: calculates a hash value using a specified algorithm
    nettle-lfib-stream: outputs a sequence of pseudorandom (non-cryptographic) bytes, using Knuth's lagged fibonacci generator. The stream is useful for testing, but should not be used to generate cryptographic keys or anything else that needs real randomness
    nettle-pbkdf2: is a password-based key derivation function that takes a password or a passphrase as input and returns a strengthened password, which is protected against pre-computation attacks by using salting and other expensive computations.
    pkcs1-conv: converts private and public RSA keys from PKCS #1 format to sexp format
    sexp-conv: converts an s-expression to a different encoding
